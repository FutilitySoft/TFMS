Bio: (Your starting rank is based on this!)<BR>
<p>Max grew up on the Alpha Centauri colony world. His father was an engineer for the capital city's main power facility. Due to this Max grew up understanding the basics of power generation and distribution at an early age.
Max grew up care free and easy going on Alpha Centauri, his love for the engineering discipline just could not be satisfied. He decided early on that he would study things dealking with energy.
</p>
<p>Max progressed through Starfleet Academy and made several tours on Starships during his early carrer. After the dominion war Max was offered a move from Engineering to ops. One which he reluctnatly took. To this day he generally keeps to himself the reasons for this, but it seems to stem back to his time on the Ganymede research base. His time there apparetnly was a turing point in his life.
</p>
<p>His first Command Duty was aboard the USS Belvior, when long time friend Captain Alexander Grant asked him to take the step from Ops to Command. He gladly followed and has now served with Alex aboard three seperate Starships.

Scenario:<BR>
<P>Please reply to the following situation as you would as your first desired
position in post form.  Please delete all of this text when doing this.</P>

<P>"It's 0330 hours and you are asleep in your quarters.  The room is dark, quiet, and you're in the middle of a great dream... when
suddenly you hear the ships alarm, and someone comes over the comm and says
"Red Alert!!"</P>

<p>Max, a light sleeper, bolts upright in bed. Quickily realizing the situation he
reaches for his Comm badge on the night stand and contacts the Bridge.

<p>HUNTER: +TAPS+ Hunter to the Bridge, What's the situation?

<P>CONCOLOR: =/\=Max this is Concolor, We've encounted some kind of Quantum
String Fragment. You'd better come to the bridge right away, and bring a
engineering kit too.

<p>HUNTER: On My Way!

<p>Hunter Pulls his uniform on quickly He looks quite unlike his usual Clean
Shaven and neatly pressed self. He leavs his quarters and heads straight for the
bridge stopping only once to pick up an Engineers Field Kit out of a side
bulkhead. He guesses there is some damage on the bridge of Concolor wouldn't
have asked for a repair kit.

<p>HUNTER: * Stepping into the Turbolift * Computer, Bridge.

<P>computer: Turbolifts are inoperative above deck 4.

<p>HUNTER: Well then, Deck 4. Center section. I guess I'll have to crawl the
rest of the way.

<P>Max, leaves the turbolift and heads straight for a Jefferies Tube. This
particular one will drop him off near his own office on Deck 2. He can use the
access ramp through the Observation lounge at that point to reach the Bridge. 

<p>When Max Arrives on the Bridge things are fairly well in hand. Captain Grant
has arrived and is Coordinating damage Control With Colquhoun the Ops Officer. 

<P>GRANT: * Noticing Max enter the bridge * Max, Excellent can you help Concolor
repair the tactical station. We should be able to restore sensors and weapons
through there. We'll likely need both ASAP to get out of this one. 

<P>HUNTER: Aye, sir. * Max heads over to TAC and opens the Kit and begins
working. *

Character name: Sorac Dunar<BR>

Race: Bajoran<BR>

Gender: Male<BR>

Birthplace: bajor<br>

Rank type Commisioned<BR><BR>

Desired Ship: USS Constantinople<BR>

<b>Bio:</b> (Your starting rank is based on this!)<BR>

<p>
Dunar is an easy going person. He tries to not let the everyday stresses of life get to him, and tries to always have a smile on his face. He consideres the best way to motivate his crew is to keep them laughing. While he is not overly funny, or into body humor he will when needed come up with a witty one-liner, or strut out of a room in dramatic fashion.

</p>

<p>
In Command Dunar generally expects a certain level of professionalism from those under him, but like to keep things light at the same time. He has been known to indulge in a few card games with his crew before. He seems quite fond of the games Black Jack, Eucher and Sabac.
In times of crisis Dunar attempts, and typically succeeds, in keeping a level head, and a confidance that he will finish a winner. While confident, he tends to consult his most trusted senior staff members on major descisions if the situation permits.

</p>

<p>
As a child his family escaped the cardassian controlled Bajor to the refugee camps. His father\'s skills with mechanical equipment proved a blessing to the family which helped them raise money for food and eventually earn them a trip away from the camps.
The Sorac family took the opertunity without even asking where the ship was heading. They later found out that the destination was Earth\'s moon Luna. Once there Dunar\'s father began working in local shuttlecraft maintanance yards. He eventually wound up earning a spot on the prestiegious McKinnly Ship Yards team. It was from here that he was able to get Dunar a chance to take the Starfleet entrance exams.

</p>

<p>
Dunar applied to the academy wanting to be in Engineering.
However, before being accepted he switched his major to Science. It was always
his first love. 
While he excelled at the sciences much of the theoretical 
math required of him was beyond his understanding. It took much work, 
and many late nights with his peers to help him in his understanding 
of his subjects. While his grades were by no means spectacular
 ( they were fairly average) he always made it though.

</p>

<p>
After graduating from the academy Dunar loooked forward to getting away 
from Earth, and out into the stars. Although he is far from home most of t
he time he tries to return to Tycho City to visit his parents whenever he 
can. In fact just before taking commmand of the Constantinople he returned 
from a pilgrimage with his father to Bajor, where they were able to be in the 
presence of one of the orbs of the prophets.

<b>Scenario:</b><BR>
<p> Dunar wakes up groggy. This is not a good time to bother him. It had better
be damn important or somebody was going to get it. Dunar, is NOT a morening
person and Has a terrible time with missing sleep.
<br>
He reaches for the Comm link on his nightstand.

<p>SORAC: Sorac, here. What's the problem. * He rubs his head to get rid of the headache.*

<p>BOND: Sir, There seems to be something wrong with our Klingon Escourt ship.
They are having power grid fluctuations and sensors are picking up weapons fire
throught the ship. 

<p>SORAC: On my way. Alert Hancock and Hunter to join me on the bridge.

Sorac, gets up and puts on his uniform. Almost walking out without attaching his
comm badge. He grabs his Phaser from his desk, just in case. Klingons, even as
allies can be very unpredictable.

<p>Sorac, reaches the bridge, and finds Hancock(XO), Hunter(2nd) and Markov(Ops)
already there. Of the three Hancock looks worst for wear. The Ex Special Op
vetran doesn't even have Jumpsuit on. He's in casual pants and a black T-shirt.
his Comm badge attached to the waist band of his pants. 

<p>SORAC: Status?

<P>MARKOV: We're showing weapons fire on board the kla'Benga.

<p>HANCOCK: * Who serverd with the Klingons during the Exchange Program * It's a
coup. One of the Senior Officers is trying to take command. 

<P>HUNTER: We should try and find out who started it and put an end to this. We
need their help for this relief mission to succeed.

<p>HANCOCK: You'll never know who it was. One side WILL destroy the other.
Unless Commander Turre himself lives, which is very unlikely. We'll never know
who was on which side, and to be perfectly honest. The klingon high Command
won't care either. Torre has no family in any important positions. 

<p>SORAC: Well I"ll have to defer to Scott on all Judgements, but I Think it's
best that we raise shields to prevent this spilling over onto the
Constantinople. Asside from that I want someone to monitor the situation and
alert us when the kla'Benga restores comm with us. Mr. Bond the Bridge is yours.
alert me if the situation changes. Be prepared for anything. These are Klingons
we're dealing with.
